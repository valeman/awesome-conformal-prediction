Uncover the hidden gems and master the art of Conformal Prediction with this all-encompassing guide. Experience the Pinnacle of Conformal Prediction Expertise: A Resource Crafted by a Pro.

This exceptional resource is the culmination of my PhD journey in Machine Learning, specializing in Conformal Prediction under the supervision of its creator, Prof. Vladimir Vovk. Since 2015, I have painstakingly gathered these invaluable resources, and upon completing my PhD (my thesis, "Machine Learning for Probabilistic Prediction," can be found in the "Theses" section), I am thrilled to share my expertise with the global machine learning community. Immerse yourself in a professionally curated collection that has been honed through years of dedication and experience.

Conformal Prediction goes back to Kolmogorov's notion of randomness described in two papers : 1) Andrei Kolmogorov (1968). "Logical basis for information theory and probability theory." IEEE Transactions on Information Theory IT-14:662-664 and 2) Andrei Kolmogorov (1983). "Combinatorial foundations of information theory and the calculus of probabilities." Russian Mathematical Surveys 38(4):29-4.  

Conformal Prediction has transcended its niche status in just a few years, experiencing exponential growth thanks to the tireless efforts of renowned ambassadors like Prof. [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/) in academia.
