The most comprehensive professionally curated resource on Conformal Prediction including the best tutorials, videos, books, papers, articles, courses, websites, conferences and open-source libraries code in Python, R and Julia.

I have created this resource after completing my PhD in Machine Learning specialising in Conformal Prediction supervised by the creator of Conformal Prediction Prof. Vladimir Vovk. The resources were meticulously collected since 2015 and after completing my PhD (thesis "Machine Learning for Probabilistic Prediction is available in the "Theses" section) I have decided to share them with the global machine learning community.

Conformal Prediction goes back to Kolmogorov's notion of randomness described in two papers : 1) Andrei Kolmogorov (1968). "Logical basis for information theory and probability theory." IEEE Transactions on Information Theory IT-14:662-664 and 2) Andrei Kolmogorov (1983). "Combinatorial foundations of information theory and the calculus of probabilities." Russian Mathematical Surveys 38(4):29-4.  

Conformal Prediction is no longer a niche area of research like it was just a few years ago, it has seen exponential growth during the last 2-3 years due to the work of amazing ambassadors of Conformal Prediction such as Prof. [Larry Wasserman](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/) in academia. There has been two tracks dedicated to conformal prediction at [ICML2021](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2021/ScheduleMultitrack?event=8373) and [ICML2022](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/dfuq-22/home) and key invited talk by Professor Emmanuel Candes 'Conformal Prediction in 2022' at [NeurIPS2022](https://slideslive.com/38996063/conformal-prediction-in-2022?ref=speaker-43789). The [main conference on Conformal Prediction (COPA)](https://copa-conference.com) has been running for over 11 years.

Awesome Conformal Prediction has been cited in the best book on Machine Learning (aka the machine learning 'bible') ["Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics"](https://github.com/probml/pml2-book) by the leading research scientist at Google (over 80K Google Scholar citations) and Bestselling Machine Learning Book Author Kevin Murphy (starting at page 555).

I am actively promoting Conformal Prediction (because it is well Awesome) on social media incluidng [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriy-manokhin-phd-mba-cqf-704731236/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/predict_addict). [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Valery-Manokhin) has all my research and I occasionally publish in [Medium](https://medium.com/@valeman) sharing insights from the data science trenches in the industry. Please feel free to connect and also help spread the word about Conformal Prediction.

Why Conformal Prediction?

One of the most influential and celebrated machine learning researchers - Professor Michael I. Jordan:

'𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗮𝗻𝘀𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗼 𝗨𝗤 (𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗿𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘆 𝗾𝘂𝗮𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻), 𝗜 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗶𝘁'𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗜 𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗲 𝘀𝗲𝗲𝗻 - 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲, 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗮𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗲𝘁𝗰.' (ICML 2021 UQ workshop). 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

One the most influential statistics Professors - Larry Wasserman (Carnegie Mellon): 

'𝗦𝗼 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗲𝗮𝘂𝘁𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝘀𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘀 𝘁𝗼 𝗱𝗼 𝗶𝘁 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗵𝗼𝘄 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝘁 𝗶𝘀. 𝗦𝗼 𝗜 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝗻, 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗮𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝘁𝘆 𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝗹 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐩𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐢𝐧 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥 𝐚𝐩𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐨𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐥 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.' 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

'Conformal inference methods are becoming all the rage in academia and industry alike. In a nutshell, these methods deliver exact prediction intervals for future observations without making any distributional assumption whatsoever other than having iid, and more generally, exchangeable data.'

Prof. Emmanual Candes (Stanford) - Neurips 2022 key talk.

https://slideslive.com/icml-2021/workshop-on-distributionfree-uncertainty-quantification


When prominent professors from the best research labs in the world say this about conformal prediction it is quite an endorsement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What about the industry one might ask - Conformal Prediction already for several years powers the main anomaly detection proposition in Microsoft Azure.

In 2021-2022 conformal prediction research experienced exponential growth in academia and with the availability of open-source libraries the industry is positioned to replicate this growth in the industry.


📢📢Industry take notice. The revolution in Uncertainty Quantification / Probabilistic Prediction / Forecasting is already here 📢📢  A big one  🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
